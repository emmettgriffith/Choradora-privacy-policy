# Choradora Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2, 2025**

## Introduction

Choradora ("we", "our", or "the app") is a family chore management app. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data We Collect

- **Account information:** name, email address, and role (parent or kid) that you provide during signup.
- **Chore data:** chores, rewards, points, streaks, and achievements you create within the app.
- **Photos:** images you optionally attach as chore completion proof. These are stored in your private iCloud container.
- **Device identifiers:** used solely for push notifications and syncing across your devices.

## How We Use Your Data

- To provide the app's core functionality: managing chores, rewards, and family accounts.
- To sync your data across your devices via iCloud.
- To send push notifications about chore reminders and updates.
- We do not sell, share, or transfer your personal data to third parties.

## Data Storage & Security

- All your data is stored in Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) under your personal Apple ID. We do not operate our own servers.
- Sensitive credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain.
- We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Children's Privacy

- Kid accounts are created and managed by a parent within the app.
- Kids do not provide an email address or any personal information beyond a display name chosen by their parent.
- We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) requirements.

## Subscriptions

- Choradora offers an auto-renewable monthly subscription.
- Payment is processed entirely by Apple through your Apple ID. We do not collect or store any payment information.
- You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.

## Third-Party Services

We use Apple's CloudKit, StoreKit, and Push Notification services. These are governed by Apple's own privacy policy. We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Your Rights

- You can delete your account and all associated data from within the app at any time.
- Since all data is stored in your private iCloud container, deleting the app and your iCloud data removes everything.
- You may contact us for any privacy-related requests.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app.
