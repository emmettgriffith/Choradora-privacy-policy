# Choradora Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 12, 2026**

## Introduction

Choradora ("we", "our", or "the app") is a family chore management app. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data We Collect

- **Account information:** name, email address, and role (parent or kid) that you provide during signup via Sign in with Apple.
- **Chore data:** chores, rewards, points, streaks, achievements, daily plans, and family events you create within the app.
- **Photos:** images you optionally attach as chore completion proof. These are stored in Apple's CloudKit alongside your family data.
- **Profile photos:** optional profile images you upload for your account.
- **User identifiers:** Apple ID credentials, iCloud record IDs, and internal account identifiers used for authentication and syncing.
- **Device identifiers:** device name (used solely to suggest a display name during setup) and push notification tokens.

## How We Use Your Data

- To provide the app's core functionality: managing chores, rewards, family accounts, daily plans, and family calendars.
- To sync your data across your devices and between family members via Apple's CloudKit.
- To send push notifications about chore reminders, approval requests, streak milestones, and weekly summaries.
- We do **not** sell, share, or transfer your personal data to third parties.
- We do **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage & Security

- Your data is stored in Apple's CloudKit, a secure cloud service managed by Apple. We do not operate our own servers.
- Family data (chores, rewards, accounts) is stored in a shared CloudKit public database so family members can sync with each other.
- Sensitive credentials such as passwords are hashed using SHA-256 and stored locally in the iOS Keychain. They are never transmitted in plaintext.
- Profile images and chore proof photos are stored as CloudKit Assets (CKAsset).
- Local caching uses UserDefaults for app preferences and quick offline access.

## Children's Privacy

- Kid accounts are created and managed by a parent or legal guardian within the app.
- Parents must provide explicit consent before creating a kid account. This consent is recorded and stored with a timestamp.
- Kids do not provide an email address or any personal information beyond a display name and age chosen by their parent.
- Kid accounts are accessed via a parent-generated login code and password — no personal Apple ID is required for kids.
- Parents can view, edit, and delete their child's account and all associated data at any time via Settings.
- We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) requirements.

## Subscriptions

- Choradora offers an auto-renewable monthly subscription for premium features.
- Payment is processed entirely by Apple through your Apple ID. We do not collect or store any payment information.
- You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following Apple services, each governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/):

- **CloudKit** — cloud data storage and sync
- **StoreKit** — in-app subscription management
- **Push Notifications (APNs)** — chore reminders and family updates
- **Sign in with Apple** — parent account authentication
- **WidgetKit** — home screen widget data

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Your Rights

- You can delete your account and all associated data from within the app at any time via Settings → Delete Account.
- Account deletion permanently removes your profile, chores, rewards, and transaction history from CloudKit.
- If you are a parent, deleting your account also removes all linked kid accounts and family data.
- You may contact us at **choradoraoffical@outlook.com** for any privacy-related requests.
