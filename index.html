    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 2, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Choradora ("we", "our", or "the app") is a family chore management app. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, and role (parent or kid) that you provide during signup.</li>
        <li><strong>Chore data:</strong> chores, rewards, points, streaks, and achievements you create within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> images you optionally attach as chore completion proof. These are stored in your private iCloud container.</li>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> used solely for push notifications and syncing across your devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the app's core functionality: managing chores, rewards, and family accounts.</li>
        <li>To sync your data across your devices via iCloud.</li>
        <li>To send push notifications about chore reminders and updates.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, share, or transfer your personal data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All your data is stored in Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) under your personal Apple ID. We do not operate our own servers.</li>
        <li>Sensitive credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your iCloud data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kid accounts are created and managed by a parent within the app.</li>
        <li>Kids do not provide an email address or any personal information beyond a display name chosen by their parent.</li>
        <li>We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choradora offers an auto-renewable monthly subscription.</li>
        <li>Payment is processed entirely by Apple through your Apple ID. We do not collect or store any payment information.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Apple's CloudKit, StoreKit, and Push Notification services. These are governed by Apple's own privacy policy. We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete your account and all associated data from within the app at any time.</li>
        <li>Since all data is stored in your private iCloud container, deleting the app and your iCloud data removes everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page and within the app.</p>
